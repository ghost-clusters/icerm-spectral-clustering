It is simple to implement, can be solved eﬃciently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the ﬁrst glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe diﬀerent graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several diﬀerent approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the diﬀerent spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.}, number={4}, journal={Statistics and Computing}, author={von Luxburg, Ulrike}, year={2007}, month={Dec}, pages={395–416} }
