		<p>Welcome to the project page for our Summer@ICERM 2020 project! </p>
		
		<p> We study the Graph Spectral Clustering algorithm, an alternative to Euclidean clustering algorithms like K-Means, which is geometrically motivated for use on data with manifold structure. It is often challenging to cluster manifold structured data because the Euclidean distance between any two points may not take into account their "true" distance along a geodesic path within the data manifold. A useful rule of thumb is that in high dimensional settings, only local Euclidean distances are meaningful. </p>

		<p>Spectral clustering takes this into account by operating on a similarity graph derived from the data. Edges in the graph represent data similarity and are typically computed with a kernel function like RBF or the exponential kernel. After obtaining the similarity graph, Graph Spectral Clustering utilizes a derived matrix, the <em>Graph Laplacian</em>.</p>

		<p>In this work, we study the role of the Graph Laplacian and connect Graph Spectral Clustering to the behavior of <em>heat diffusion</em>, which is governed by a second order PDE involving the Laplacian operator. For more information, please see <a href="#">our report</a>!</p>

		<h1>Demonstrations</h1>
		<img width="80%" style="margin: 2% 10%" src="html/demo/Eigenvector_Evolution_BrokenCircle.gif" />
		<p style="margin: 0% 10%;font-size: 12px; color: #808080" width="80%">The domain is a circle graph with two equidistant low-weight edges. In the first row, we show consecutive eigenvectors of the Graph Laplacian. In the second row, we show how diffusion of random initial conditions converges to eigenvectors of the Graph Laplacian. Different columns show the solution projected onto increasingly high eigenvectors (ie. "high frequencies"). The third row shows energy remaining after this projection.</p>
